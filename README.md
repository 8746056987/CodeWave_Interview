# CodeWave_Interview

Project Titile :
Interview Application

Installation:
1) Clone the Project
2) Checkout To Master Branch 
3) Do npm install
4) Run react-native-run-android

Packages Used:
react-native-gesture-handler - Used for react native navigation 
react-native-webview

Assumptions:
1) Typing in any keywords should look for the exact match of those
keywords in the “title” field of the feed items in the currently active tab. 
As you mentioned in the above requirements  "title" has the same value in every record coming from the response author name is different therefore I have implemented search functionality for both title and author name  is that ok ? because if we search for the title it will show every record right please give me your inputs.

2) So if a user searches in Tab 1 and then swipes to Tab 2, Tab 1 should
show filtered results but Tab 2 should show all results.
In the above requirements tab2 and tab3 should have the same contents like tab1 right?

3) In design we have other contents like message icon and heart icon and all is it needed to display or whatever is mentioned in the requirements enough ?
